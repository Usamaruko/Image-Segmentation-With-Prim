# Image-Segmentation-With-Prim
Prim-based Image Segmentation
  This method employs Prim's algorithm to perform image segmentation, utilizing a network-like structure to aid in generating segmentation results, suitable for images with clear contrasts. Initially, the image to be segmented is loaded and converted into a suitable data structure for processing. Subsequently, one or more seed pixels are selected within the image to serve as the starting point for segmentation, either manually or automatically determined.
  Next, Prim's algorithm is utilized to construct a minimum spanning network between the seed pixels and their neighboring pixels. By iteratively selecting pixels with the lowest weight that are adjacent to the current segmentation region, the segmentation area is gradually expanded. This process forms a segmentation strategy based on a network-like structure.
